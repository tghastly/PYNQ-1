Example Jupyter Notebooks
==============================

Jupyter Notebook is a rich environment to demonstrate the functionality of an overlay. 

Example Jupyter notebooks can be delivered as part of an overlay. Notebooks can be considered as an interactive training document for an overlay. As the notebook will contain the Python code to interact with a notebook, but can be executed directly by a user, this is a very convenient way to get started learning about and using a new overlay. 

Examples of PYNQ notebooks can be found in the **examples** directory in the Jupyter Notebook home area on the board. 

Notebooks can be created and packaged with the overlay, and copied to the board during the installation of a new overlay. 

It is recommended that at least one notebook covering basic features is included with an overlay.
