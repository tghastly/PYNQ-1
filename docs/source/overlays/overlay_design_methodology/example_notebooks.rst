Example Jupyter Notebooks
==============================

Jupyter Notebook is a rich environment to demonstrate the functionality of an overlay. 

Notebooks can be considered as an interactive training document for an overlay. Example Jupyter notebooks can be delivered as part of an overlay to help users learn how to use an overlay, and find out about its capability. As the notebook will contain the Python code to interact with a notebook, but can be executed directly by a user. This is a very convenient way to get started learning about and using a new overlay. 

Notebooks can contain code cells, and Markdown cells. Markdown cells can contain explanatory text, images, equations, graphs. The output of code cells can be saved to a notebook document that can be distributed electronically, or published online. Notebooks documents render on GitHub where they can be viewed as a webpage, with results embedded. The GitHub *Gist* facility also allows direct upload of Notebooks without needing to manage a Git repository. 

Examples of PYNQ notebooks can be found in the **examples** directory in the Jupyter Notebook home area on the board. 

Notebooks can be created and packaged with an overlay, and copied to the board during the installation of a new overlay. 

It is recommended that at least one notebook covering basic features is included with an overlay.
